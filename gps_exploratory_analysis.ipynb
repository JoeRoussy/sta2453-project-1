However, that is not the case for max acceleration (p_value is large). This shows, that max speed might be a better metric of performance for players compared to max acceleration.\n",
    "Also in general it is worth to note that if a player's speed was 0 in one frame and 0.4 (m/s) in the next frame, its acceleartion would be 4 which is relatively a large value. Also if a player keeps his/her high speed, its acceleration will be close to zero and will not show the true performance of the player. So using max speed as a measure of performance seems more reasonable than using acceleration."
